In this project, I developed an interactive HR analytics dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee performance metrics and attrition trends. The dashboard provides actionable insights to HR and management teams, helping them identify patterns in employee turnover and evaluate factors affecting retention and performance. Key features include:

Attrition Rate Analysis: Visualizations of employee attrition segmented by department, job role, age group, education level, and years at company.

Performance Monitoring: Performance rating distribution and trends across various employee demographics and departments.

KPI Tracking: Key HR metrics such as average tenure, satisfaction level, monthly attrition trends, and training time.

Interactivity: Slicers and filters for dynamic exploration of data (e.g., by department or job role).

Goal: To support HR decision-making with data-driven insights, reduce employee churn, and improve workforce planning.
